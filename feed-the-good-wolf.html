            <h1>Feed the Good Wolf</h1>
   
<p>An old Cherokee told his grandson.&nbsp;"My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all."</p>
<p>"One is Evil. It is anger, jealousy, greed, resentment, inferiority, lies and ego."</p>
<p>"The other is Good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, humanity, kindess, empathy and truth."</p>
<p>The boy thought about it, and asked, "Grandfather, which wolf wins?"</p>
<p>The old man quietly replied, "The one you feed."</p>
