            <h1>The Cake is not a lie</h1>
   
<p>It was my daughter's first birthday recently, so I decided that I would start a little father-daughter tradition, and bake her a cake.</p>
<h2>The Sponge</h2>
<p>Me being me, I started to prepare about 6 weeks in advance of her big day. To begin with, I wanted to test out some sponges which would taste nice and have a good texture for my final cake. I decided to try out a Madeira cake recipe which I found on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/madeiracake_73878" title="BBC Food Madeira Cake Recipe" target="_blank">BBC Food website</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turned out to be really tasty, and the recipe I used in the final cake. I did try some other recipes (one for an Orange cake) but they really didn't taste as nice.</p>

<h2>The Icing</h2>
<p>Once I had decided upon the sponge, I thought I would try out some icing, however after tasting this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/basicbuttericing_73263/" title="BBC Food Butter Cream Recipe" target="_blank">Butter Cream icing</a>, I didn't bother with any other!</p>
<h2>The Prototype</h2>
<p>So the week before the big day, I took my previous 3 weeks baking experience, and made a prototype. Madeira cake, butter cream and blue food colouring. 2 Layers of Madeira cake, roughly shaped, with some icing slapped onto it!</p>

<h2>The final version</h2>
<p>The night before the big day. I made the final cake. 4 Layers of Madeira cake carefully carved and holed out in the centre, butter cream smoothed out and then given a pattern with a pallet knife, edible silver shine spray, and a real Cinderella doll!</p>

<p>I hope you like the final result!</p>
