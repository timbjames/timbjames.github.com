            <h1>Asp.Net CheckBoxList missing value attribute</h1>
   
<p>I am working on an asp.net WebSite project, rather than a Web Application project, and copying code from a Web Application project. The code I am copying is part of a system which has been used for many clients, and this process has been done before e.g. copy and past :P However this one is different because of the Website project.</p>
<p>I have noticed a bug, in that the CheckBoxList, on this particular Website project, is not rendering the value attibute. Now this is causing me an unwanted headache!</p>
<p>I need to investigate this more to find out WHY!</p>
<h2>In the meantime</h2>
<p>I have basically coded a work around by adding the class attibute with the value in there so that I can access it via javascript.</p>
<h2>Help me obi-wan</h2>
<p>If anyone has any clues, leave a comment please!</p>
<h2 style="color: orange;">Update</h2>
<p>After further investigation, it turns out that when creating a new Web Site in .Net 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5, then the value attribute of a checkbox is never created. A .Net 4.0 Web Site will create the value attribute as expected.</p>
