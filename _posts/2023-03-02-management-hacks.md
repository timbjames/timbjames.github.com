## 1. You're NOT an elevated individual contributor

You likely made it into a manager position because you proved you could be successful at the job you were doing as an individual contributor, but not because you proved your ability to manage a group of individual contributors.

Those are two very different things! Just like you can't wake up one day and play a concerto on the piano if you've never played before, you probably won't wake up and automatically know what to do to be the world's best manager. It's a skill that must develop, just like any other skill.

So, consider yourself an apprentice. This is a time to learn how to step into the leadership role your team needs you to take, how to delegate effectively, and how to inspire your team to put in their best every day. If you make a mistake or two along the way, own it and then promise to do better.

## 2. Adaptation is your magic bullet

Want your people to be highly productive? Motivated? Creative? Innovative? Then you need to learn how to adapt your work style to theirs.
Everyone you're managing will bring a different natural work style to the office, which means they all have different things that are going to inspire and motivate them or hold them back from doing their best work.
