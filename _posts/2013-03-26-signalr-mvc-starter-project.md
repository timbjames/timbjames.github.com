If you haven't already checked out what is going on with SignalR, then I suggest you go take a look over at Scott Hanselman's blog and read up about it http://www.hanselman.com/blog/archives.aspx#SignalR and then go to the SignalR website and read the documentation there http://signalr.net/ as it may be the solution to some of your Real-Time problems that you might come across.
