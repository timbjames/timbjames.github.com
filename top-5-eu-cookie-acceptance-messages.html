            <h1>Top 5 EU Cookie Compliance Acceptance Messages</h1>
   
<p>On 26th May 2012 all UK websites must offer users opt-in consent tools to allow cookies that pass information about your browsing activities to 3rd parties. Optanon is a managed software service that enables you to make your website compliant.</p>
<h2>Top 5 Cookie Compliance Acceptance Messages</h2>
<h3>No 2.</h3>

<p>"Cookies on the BBC website. We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

<h3>No 1.</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ft.com" title="Financial Times" target="_blank">http://www.ft.com</a></p>
<p>Landing on the Financial Times' website, you imediatelly get a Modal popup with one option "Close". Basically, as soon as you click "Close" you are agreeing to allowing their site to use 3rd party cookies. Personally I think this is the best way to do it. If someone wants to use your site, but is fussy about cookies, then it is up to them to sort it out.</p>
<p>"By closing this message, you consent to our cookies on this device in accordance with our cookie policy unless you have disabled them."</p>
<h2>Hey, where are no.s 3, 4 &amp; 5?</h2>
<p>Well, I have yet to find any other UK websites with a cookie compliance acceptance message! Great to see them all taking this new EU law seriously!</p>
<h3 style="color: orange;">Little jQuery Plugin</h3>
<p>I have written a little jQuery plugin which you can use to display a Modal popup message similar to the two above. <a href="https://github.com/timbjames/Stacks/tree/master/WebApp/cookie-compliance" title="jQuery Cookie Compliance Acceptance" target="_blank">Check it out at my Git Hub</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>Since writing this, a few more have popped up.</p>
