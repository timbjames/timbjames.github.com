    <h1>Render ASP.Net controls without Form tag</h1>
    	
    <p>After all these years building websites with ASP.Net, I have never been in this situation before. I was trying to simply render a server control on a page which didn't have a Form tag.</p>
    
    <p>Of course this naturally produces an error</p>
    
    <pre>...must be placed inside a form tag with runat="server"</pre>
    
    <p>An easy solution is to override the Page.VerifyRenderingInServerForm Method.</p>
    
    <p><strong>C#</strong></p>
    
    <pre>public override void VerifyRenderingInServerForm(Control control){
    &nbsp; &nbsp; return;
    }</pre>
    
    <p><strong>VB</strong></p>
    
    <pre>Public Overrides Sub VerifyRenderingInServerForm(control As System.Web.UI.Control)
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Return
    End Sub</pre>
       
    <p>A Voila!</p>
        <p>I am always interested in hearing back from those who read my blog. Please leave a comment if you found this useful, want to suggest any changes to my code, or anything else! Thanks!</p>
